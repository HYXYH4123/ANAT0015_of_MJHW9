# LineIntensity.xlsx
This file contains raw fluorescence intensity measurements acquired from rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) within cells expressing EGFP-WAVE2, StayGold-E138D-WAVE2, or mStayGold2-WAVE2. 

## Column Names
- 'Date' - The date when the cell image was captured.
- 'Microscopy' - The name of the microscope used for imaging. Zeiss Elyra 7 is a widefield microscope, while Nikon SoRa is a confocal microscope.
- 'CellLine' - The cell line used for transfection to express GFPs; either KnockOut (KO) or WildType (WT).
- 'GFP' - The GFP variant used to transfect the B16F1 cell line. EGFP_W2 refers to EGFP-WAVE2; SG_W2 refers to StayGold-E138D-WAVE2; mSG2_W2 refers to mStayGold2-WAVE2.
- 'YFP' - The yellow or red fluorescent protein used for co-transfection. Not all cells are transfected with YFP. N1_mSL refers to Nap1-mScarlet.
- 'CellNo' - A unique identifier assigned to each cell.
