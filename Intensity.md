- 'Date' - The date when the cell image was captured.
- 'Microscopy' - The name of the microscope used for imaging. Zeiss Elyra 7 is a widefield microscope, while Nikon SoRa is a confocal microscope.
- 'CellLine' - The cell line used for transfection to express GFPs; either KnockOut (KO) or WildType (WT).
- 'GFP' - The GFP variant used to transfect the B16F1 cell line. EGFP_W2 refers to EGFP-WAVE2; SG_W2 refers to StayGold-E138D-WAVE2; mSG2_W2 refers to mStayGold2-WAVE2.
- 'YFP' - The yellow or red fluorescent protein used for co-transfection. Not all cells are transfected with YFP. N1_mSL refers to Nap1-mScarlet.
- 'CellNo' - A unique identifier assigned to each cell.
- 'Distance' - The position along the measured line toward the nucleus (a larger value indicates closer proximity to the nucleus).
- 'LT1' - Initial intensity measured from line 1.
- 'LT2' - Initial intensity measured from line 2.
- 'LT3' - Initial intensity measured from line 3.
- 'LT4' - Final intensity measured from line 4 after five minutes of laser exposure, reflecting the photobleaching effect.
- 'LT5' - Final intensity measured from line 5 after five minutes of laser exposure, reflecting the photobleaching effect.
- 'LT6' - Final intensity measured from line 6 after five minutes of laser exposure, reflecting the photobleaching effect.
- 'LT123Ave' - The average intensity of LT1, LT2, and LT3.
- 'LT456Ave' - The average intensity of LT4, LT5, and LT6.
- 'Bleach' - The photobleaching ratio calculated as LT456Ave divided by LT123Ave.
- 'LT123AvePer' - The normalized LT123Ave intensity, calculated by dividing each value by the maximum LT123Ave for that CellNo.
- 'LT456AvePer' - The normalized LT456Ave intensity, calculated by dividing each value by the maximum LT456Ave for that CellNo.
