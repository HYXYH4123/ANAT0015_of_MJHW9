# Supplemental Information for MJHW9's ANAT0015 project.

This Github includes the raw fluorescence intensity data and the analytical Python script for the project. 

## File names
- LI_EGmSG2 - This file contains line intensity measurements for cells expressing EGFP-WAVE2 and mStayGold2-WAVE2.
- LI_SG - This file contains line intensity measurements for cells expressing StayGold-E138D-WAVE2.
- MJHW9_ANAT0015_Code - This file contains Python code for preprocessing, analyzing, and visualising fluorescence intensity data from cells expressing various GFP-tagged WAVE2 constructs.

As part of the data analysis process, I acknowledge the use of the generative AI tool ChatGPT-4 (https://chatgpt.com) during the development of Python scripts. All code was written with full understanding, verified, and finalized by the author.
