# Data Analysis for MJHW9's ANAT0015 project.

This Github includes the raw fluorescence intensity data and the analytical Python script for the project. 

## File names
- LineIntensity – This file contains raw fluorescence intensity measurements acquired along a line-shaped region of interest (ROI) across individual cells expressing EGFP-WAVE2, StayGold-E138D-WAVE2, or mStayGold2-WAVE2.
- AreaIntensity – This file contains raw fluorescence intensity measurements acquired from rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) within cells expressing EGFP-WAVE2, StayGold-E138D-WAVE2, or mStayGold2-WAVE2.
- MJHW9_ANAT0015_Code - This file contains Python code for preprocessing, analyzing, and visualising fluorescence intensity data from cells expressing various GFP-tagged WAVE2 constructs.

As part of the data analysis process, I acknowledge the use of the generative AI tool ChatGPT-4 (https://chatgpt.com) during the development of Python scripts. All code was written with full understanding, verified, and finalized by the author.
