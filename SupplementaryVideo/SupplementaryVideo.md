## üìΩÔ∏è Video Content

### üîπ Overview

The videos in this repository represent **time-lapse imaging of B16F1 melanoma cells** expressing different GFP-tagged constructs to visualize lamellipodia dynamics. These videos demonstrate the **photostability** and **subcellular localization** of the following fluorescent proteins when fused to WAVE2:

* **EGFP-WAVE2**
* **StayGold-E138D-WAVE2**
* **mStayGold2-WAVE2**
* **Control EGFP (non-tagged)**

Each video captures **dynamic changes in lamellipodial structure** over time, illustrating how each fluorescent tag performs in terms of signal retention, photostability, and spatial distribution at the cell edge.

### üîπ Video Description

1. **EGFP-WAVE2 Time-Lapse**

   * Shows the formation and dynamic behavior of **lamellipodia** in WAVE1/2 double-knockout B16F1 cells expressing **EGFP-WAVE2**.
   * The video demonstrates **rapid photobleaching** over a 5-minute period, with a noticeable decrease in fluorescence intensity and loss of lamellipodial signal clarity.
   * Initial intensity is high, but signal quality decreases due to **EGFP‚Äôs susceptibility to photobleaching**.

2. **StayGold-E138D-WAVE2 Time-Lapse**

   * Demonstrates the **enhanced photostability** of the StayGold-E138D fusion protein.
   * The **fluorescent signal remains sharp** and consistent throughout the imaging duration, indicating superior **signal retention** compared to EGFP.
   * This video highlights the **low photobleaching rate** of the StayGold-E138D variant, maintaining visibility of fine lamellipodial structures.

3. **mStayGold2-WAVE2 Time-Lapse**

   * Captures the dynamic **edge localization of WAVE2** tagged with mStayGold2, emphasizing **stable and bright fluorescence** throughout the time-lapse.
   * This construct shows **even better signal stability** than StayGold-E138D, with no visible decrease in lamellipodial intensity during prolonged imaging.
   * The video highlights the **advantages of using monomeric StayGold2 for live-cell imaging**, particularly for long-duration studies.

4. **Control EGFP (Non-Tagged) Time-Lapse**

   * Used as a **negative control** to demonstrate the baseline photobleaching behavior of **non-tagged EGFP**.
   * Shows **severe fluorescence loss** within the first few minutes, emphasizing the **poor photostability** of conventional EGFP under continuous laser illumination.
   * Useful for comparing the **relative performance of GFP variants** in the same experimental setup.
